It is the successor to Chrono Trigger, which was released in 1995 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Chrono Cross was developed primarily by scenarist and director Masato Kato and other designers from Chrono Trigger, including art director Yasuyuki Honne and composer Yasunori Mitsuda. Nobuteru Y\u016bki designed the characters of the game.\r\n\r\nThe story of Chrono Cross focuses on a teenage boy named Serge and a theme of parallel worlds. Faced with an alternate reality in which he died as a child, Serge endeavors to discover the truth of the two worlds' divergence. The flashy thief Kid and many other characters assist him in his travels around the tropical archipelago El Nido. Struggling to uncover his past and find the mysterious Frozen Flame, Serge is chiefly challenged by Lynx, a shadowy antagonist working to apprehend him.\r\n\r\nUpon its release in Japan and North America in 2000, Chrono Cross received high ratings and critical acclaim, earning a perfect 10.0 score from GameSpot.[3][4] The game shipped 1.5 million copies worldwide, leading to a Greatest Hits re-release and continued life in Japan as part of the Ultimate Hits series.[5][6] Chrono Cross was released on July 6, 2011 on the Japanese PlayStation Network and on November 8, 2011 in North America.[7] Square also released a \"Millennium Edition\" featuring a calendar, clock, and music sampler disc.", "last_modified": "2013-08-31T21:27:25.764", "published": "2013-08-31T20:33:52.496", "slug": "another-sequel-to-a-great-rpg"}}, {"pk": "Earthbound is a Quirky RPG", "model": "articles.article", "fields": {"author": 3, "summary": "Earthbound is a quirky RPG, as indicated by the title of the article.", "content": "EarthBound, originally released as Mother 2: Gyiyg Strikes Back (\u30de\u30b6\u30fc2 \u30ae\u30fc\u30b0\u306e\u9006\u8972 Maz\u0101 Ts\u016b: G\u012bgu no Gyakush\u016b?)[1] in Japan, is a role-playing video game co-developed by Ape and HAL Laboratory and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System video game console.

It was designed by Shigesato Itoi, who also developed its predecessor, the Japan-exclusive Mother. The game was released as Mother 2 in Japan on August 27, 1994, and rebranded as EarthBound for its June 5, 1995 North American release.[2] Despite its poor sales figures, the game has been lauded by gamers for its humorous depictions of American culture and parody of the role-playing video game genre,[3] and has since become a cult classic.[4]\r\n\r\nA sequel to EarthBound for the Nintendo 64DD, titled EarthBound 64, was in development for many years before finally being canceled.[5] This project later resurfaced as a Game Boy Advance title called Mother 3 and was released only in Japan.[6] Like Mother, Mother 3 has only a loose connection to EarthBound, starring new characters, though it does include several returning characters.

However, most later localizations used the original title. Final Fantasy VI was the first game in the series to be directed by someone other than producer and series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi; the role was filled instead by Yoshinori Kitase and Hiroyuki Ito. Yoshitaka Amano, a long-time contributor to the Final Fantasy series, returned as the image and character designer, while regular composer Nobuo Uematsu wrote the game's score, which has been released on several soundtrack albums.\r\n\r\nReleased to critical acclaim, Final Fantasy VI was a landmark title for the role-playing genre and is often considered one of the greatest video games of all time.

The show's premise focuses on a fourth grader named Arnold who lives with his grandparents in a large city. Episodes center on his experiences navigating big city life while dealing with the problems he and his friends encounter, including urban legends. Certain episodes focus on the lives of supporting characters, such as the tenants of the boarding house that Arnold's grandparents own.\r\n\r\nBartlett's idea for the show is based on a minor character named Arnold whom he created while working on Pee-wee's Playhouse. The executives enjoyed the character, and Bartlett completed the cast by drawing inspiration from people he grew up with in Portland, Oregon. He created the pilot episode in his living room in 1993, and official production began in 1994. The animators worked to transform Arnold from clay animation to cel animation.\r\n\r\nThe series aired on Nickelodeon from October 7, 1996, until June 8, 2004. Hey Arnold! received generally positive reviews, with many critics praising its character development and the quality of its animation. Over the course of its eight-year run, the series aired 100 episodes. A feature film based on the series, Hey Arnold!: The Movie, was released in 2002 to generally negative reviews.

Nintendo Power magazine described aspects of Chrono Trigger as revolutionary, including its multiple endings, plot-related sidequests focusing on character development, unique battle system, and detailed graphics.[9] Chrono Trigger was the third best-selling game of 1995, and the game's SNES and PlayStation iterations have shipped 2.65 million copies as of March 2003.[10][11] The version for the Nintendo DS sold 790,000 copies as of March 2009.[12] Chrono Trigger was also ported to mobile phones,[13] Virtual Console,[14] the PlayStation Network (only in the U.S.),[15] iOS devices,[16] and Android devices.[17]", "last_modified": "2013-08-31T20:02:01.525", "published": "2013-08-31T20:02:01.525", "slug": "so-chrono-trigger-is-pretty-awesome"}}, {"pk": "Starfox 64: The Best Sequel Ever", "model": "articles.article", "fields": {"author": 2, "summary": "This is the best sequel ever made.

It was the second three-dimensional Nintendo-developed game (behind 1992's X, also developed by Nintendo EAD together with then Argonaut Software) and it included the Super FX chip, a coprocessor used to accelerate graphics display, which became Nintendo's first game to use 3D polygon graphics. The complex display of three-dimensional models with polygons was still new and uncommon in console video games, and the game was much-hyped as a result.\r\n\r\nStar Fox featured anthropomorphic character designs by Nintendo artist Takaya Imamura, music composed by Hajime Hirasawa and obstacle course style gameplay. Star Fox was developed by Nintendo EAD with assistance by Argonaut Software, and was published by Nintendo. The game was a critical and commercial success, which established Star Fox as one of Nintendo's flagship franchises.\r\n\r\nThe storyline involves Fox McCloud and the rest of the Star Fox team, who must defend their homeworld of Corneria against the attacking forces of Andross.[1]", "last_modified": "2013-08-31T19:53:28.035", "published": "2013-08-31T19:42:11.882", "slug": "starfox-is-pretty-awesome"}}, {"pk": "The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past", "model": "articles.article", "fields": {"author": 2, "summary": "This is one of the first SNES games I've ever played and to this day it remains one of the best games ever made.", "content": "The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, known as Zelda no Densetsu: Kamigami no Triforce (\u30bc\u30eb\u30c0\u306e\u4f1d\u8aac \u795e\u3005\u306e\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30b9 Zeruda no Densetsu: Kamigami no Toraif\u014dsu?, lit. \"The Legend of Zelda: The Triforce of the Gods\") in Japan, is a 2D action-adventure video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System video game console. It is the third installment in The Legend of Zelda series and was released in 1991 in Japan and 1992 in North America and Europe. Shigeru Miyamoto and his team were solely responsible for this game's development.\r\n\r\nThe plot of A Link to the Past focuses on Link as he travels on a journey to save Hyrule, defeat Ganon and rescue the seven descendants of the Sages. A Link to the Past uses a 3/4 top-down perspective similar to that of the original The Legend of Zelda, dropping the side scrolling elements of Zelda II: The Adventure of Link. A Link to the Past introduced elements to the series that are still commonplace today, such as the concept of an alternate or parallel world, the Master Sword and other new weapons and items.\r\n\r\nReleased to critical and commercial success, A Link to the Past was a landmark title for Nintendo and is widely considered today to be one of the greatest video games of all time. A Link to the Past has sold over 4 million units world wide and has been ported to both the Game Boy Advance (with slight changes) and the Wii's Virtual Console. Both ports were very popular and contributed to the overall success of the game.
